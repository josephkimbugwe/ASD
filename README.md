# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Infants (4-11) using various machine learning classifiers. This project evaluates the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for accurate ASD prediction.

## Core Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented several machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used cross-validation to assess model stability and generalization.
   - Compared model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves.
   - Visualized performance metrics using plots like ROC curves.

4. **Model Interpretation**
   - Analyzed feature importance to understand the contribution of different features to the prediction.
